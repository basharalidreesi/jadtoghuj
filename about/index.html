title: About
layout: Welcome to my digital world ! I am a self-taught fashion stylist and creative
  director. I began my styling career by experimenting on myself with different types
  of garments and silhouettes and on my own body. Through a process of learning through
  deliberate experimentation, I grew a keen fondness for editorial styling. Throughout
  the past three years, I have collaborated with many Jordanian designers and international
  brand names and participated in a number of local fashion events. I usually find
  inspiration in electronic and alternative music, my surroundings and current events,
  I approach each new project with the intent to chart a common ground between client
  needs and the experimental editorial aesthetic.
