                                        <p>I am a self-taught fashion stylist and creative director. I began my styling career by experimenting with different garments and silhouettes and grew fond of editorial styling. I have collaborated with many Jordanian designers and international brand names throughout the past three years and participated in several local fashion events. I usually find inspiration in electronic and alternative music, my surroundings, and current events. I approach each new project with the intent of charting a common ground between client needs and the experimental editorial aesthetic.</p>
